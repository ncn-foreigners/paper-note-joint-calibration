# Repo for the paper "A note on joint calibration estimators for totals and quantiles"

The working paper is available [here](paper/beresewicz-szymkowiak-jointcalib.pdf).

## Preliminaries

Install `jointCalib` package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ncn-foreigners/jointCalib")
remotes::install_github("ncn-foreigners/nonprobsvy") ## for IPW with calibration constraints
```

Then, restart R  and load the package

```{r}
library(jointCalib)
library(nonprobsvy)
```
